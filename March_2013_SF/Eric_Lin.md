###Bio

Hello! My name is Eric. I am a recent graduate from the University of Windsor with a Masters of Science in Statistics. While data analysis in academia is exciting and rewarding in its own way, I often found it difficult to show my results in a meaningful and understandable form. While searching for interactive graphing options, I discovered that a lot of them required coding knowledge. Fortunately, I quite enjoyed picking up coding and this led me to App Academy where I spent over 10 hours a day living and breathing code for nine weeks. 

After App Academy, I feel confident in my ability to code in Ruby and Javascript and, more importantly, I am certain that I will be able to learn new technologies at a rapid pace.

Capstone Project:
My first capstone project revolves around data visualization. Originally the idea was to be able to connect to SQL databases and, using d3.js, generate interactive and informative graphs. Currently, the web app only accepts .csv files in specific formats. The available graphs are scatter, line, bar, pie and area. The main technologies used for this project are Javascript, Backbone.js, Rails, and d3.js.
