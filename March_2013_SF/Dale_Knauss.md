###Bio

Is your company looking for an eager junior developer to develop into a star performer?

If so, I want to talk to you.

As a passionate lifelong learner, problem solver, and creator, it's only natural that I would come to love programming.

I'm previously an online marketing consultant with several years of experience helping small and mid-sized businesses grow online.

Since discovering the amazing potential of programming, I've devoted myself to becoming a great developer.

With the help of nine intense weeks (nearly 800 hours!) at App Academy, I have gained a fantastic base of experience on which to build.

Now I'm looking to take my learning to the next level. My ideal employer is doing something important that I can get behind and is willing mentor me into reaching my full potential.

I look forward to meeting you on Demo Day!

### Projects
[Code Notes](http://codenotes.herokuapp.com/) - CodeNotes aims to make taking and organizing notes about programming easier. You can break notes down into sortable key concepts, code samples (typed through an on browser code editor with code highlighting), and todos for easy searching. See the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/daleknauss/Code-Notes) for more info.
