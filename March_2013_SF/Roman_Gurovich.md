###Bio

I like making stuff. In middle school, I scratched together games with Visual basic. These days I can be found building significantly more robust applications. After a degree in Psychology at UC Irvine and a six-year career in IT (analysis/QA/management), I’m glad to be writing code again. As an avid learner and avowed tinkerer, the ideal situation would involve full-stack development using newer technologies, fast iteration cycles, accountability, and opportunities for mentorship.

I’m looking to join a team that follows at least 8 of the 12 measures on The Joel Test http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html


Capstone Projects

Dish.io

Single page app on Backbone with home-brewed authentication. Allows a user to send and receive anonymous feedback to/from trusted friends and colleagues.

Complex ActiveRecord associations, Backbone-Relational models, filtered and sorted collections, JSON Rails API, Twitter Bootstrap, SCSS, CSS3 transitions, auto-disappearing flash notices and sliding forms with JQuery, seamless data updates with AJAX, avatars with Paperclip, namespaced Javascript, and DRY view elements through custom helpers.

GoOutside

A RESTful Rails app that serves a subset of people who’d otherwise be using Meetup.com. As an organizer for a Capture The Flag group with 600+ members, I always wanted a platform better suited to hosting outdoor activities. Now I’m building it.

GoogleMaps API, Devise for authentication, CarrierWave for images, and a bunch of DRY Rails goodness with my own checkbox tag helper in the views, and more elegant templating with HAML. Snatches of CoffeeScript may be found on the client-side for dynamic forms.
