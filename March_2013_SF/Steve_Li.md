#Steve Li

###Bio

I'm Steve and I'm a newly minted web application developer.  I arrived here by way of mathematics.  After graduating with a B.A. degree in math, I worked for a few years as an actuary before going back to school and earning a masters, also in math.  I did my thesis in discrete harmonic analysis, a field rich in theory as well as applications in signals processing.  While earning my masters, I worked as a MATLAB programmer on funded academic projects.  Using my math background, I came up with algorithms and conducted signals processing experiments in MATLAB.  My work led to a co-publication in the peer-reviewed Journal of the Acoustical Society of America but it also got me interested programming.  I decided to pursue software development as a career and the App Academy seemed like a perfect opportunity.

Through the App Academy, I learned Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, CSS and related web technologies.  But I also learned other fundamental developer skills like collaborating with others, testing and debugging, reading documentation, delivering large-scale projects under a deadline, and staying at the office until dusk.  My goal from this point on is to continue learning and become an expert in a specific area of web development.  I'm excited to speak with you about your company and embark on my new journey as a web developer.

###Capstone Project

My capstone project is an internet forum package built on Rails, jQuery and Bootstrap.  Much like phpbb, but with modern "reddit"-innovations like nested-replies and upvotes.
