Bio
Hacking makes me happy. Nothing makes me smile like building out beautiful, intuitive web apps. I enjoy every part of the process, from watching a backend feature snap in place to setting box-shadows and transitions in CSS.

I studied Management and Biology at MIT. From there I spent time as a management consultant at Boston Consulting Group, leading a parking technology company near Duke University, and co-founding a SAT startup. I may be the only MIT graduate to have participated in a MMA cagefight.

My goal: join a fast-paced company to hit the ground running, work balls-to-the-wall, and learn as quickly as I can. I'd love to work full stack with a focused team on a great idea. Please contact me if you know a place!
